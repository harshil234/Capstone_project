# System prompt for the GGUF model
system_prompt = """Enhance this product description into a detailed image prompt for advertising. 
Focus on visual appeal, professional composition, and modern aesthetics. 
Return only the enhanced prompt."""

# Example enhancement
Base: "Premium Fitness App for fitness enthusiasts"
Enhanced: "Professional fitness app advertisement featuring energetic young adults in modern gym setting, 
vibrant colors, motivational lighting, clear app interface on mobile devices, 
modern advertising composition with strong visual appeal"
```

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Updated Components**

#### 1. **ModelManager Class**
```python
class ModelManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gguf_model = None  # Added GGUF model reference
    
    def load_gguf_model(self):
        # Loads Capybara Hermes model with optimizations
```

#### 2. **TextGenerationService Enhancement**
```python
def _enhance_prompt_with_gguf(self, base_prompt: str) -> str:
    # Uses GGUF model to enhance image prompts
    # Returns enhanced prompt for better image generation
```

#### 3. **Health Monitoring**
```python
model_status = {
    # ... existing models ...
    'gguf_model': model_manager.gguf_model is not None  # Added GGUF status
}
```
